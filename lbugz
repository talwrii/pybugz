lbugz: execute bugz from the git repository.

This script is primarily used to test bugz. It is a wrapper which adds
the package directory to the system path and executes bin/bugz from the
git repository passing along any arguments supplied to it.

This is based on a patch from Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>.
